<em>CARL</em> AZUZ, <em>CNN</em> ANCHOR: Welcome to <em>CNN</em> STUDENT NEWS. Your <em>commercial-free</em> source for news for the classroom. <em>I`m</em> <em>Carl</em> Azuz. And the first story we are covering today involves a man named <em>Kenneth</em> Bae. He is a U.S. citizen. In 2012, he was arrested in North <em>Korea</em> where he gave tours to people who wanted to visit. <em>Bae</em> was sentenced to 15 years in the North <em>Korean</em> labor camp. We don`t know exactly why. North <em>Korea</em> says he was trying to take down the country`s government. His mother thinks it might be because <em>Bae</em> is a <em>devout</em> Christian. And that he didn`t understand the rules of North Korea, an <em>atheist</em> country. On Monday, <em>Bae</em> gave a statement that said he committed a serious crime against North Korea. </p>

<p> 
</p>
<p>"I would like to <em>plead</em> with the U.S. government, press and my family to stop <em>worsening</em> my situation by making wild <em>rumors</em> against North <em>Korea</em> and releasing materials related to me, which are not based on the facts. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>AZUZ: We don`t know if <em>Bae</em> was speaking sincerely, though. North <em>Korea</em> has forced prisoners to make statements like that in the past. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me. <em>I`m</em> a U.S. government agency that was established in 1952. My director is always a <em>high-ranking</em> military officer. <em>I`m</em> <em>America`s</em> most secret intelligence agency. <em>I`m</em> the National Security Agency, responsible for collecting foreign information and keeping U.S. information secure. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>AZUZ: We`ve talked about <em>Edward</em> Snowden. He`s a former <em>NSA</em> worker who <em>revealed</em> secret information about the agency, that it collects <em>Americans`</em> phone records and email info, among other data. Some believe, this helps keep the country safer and monitor potential <em>terrorist</em> activity. Other see it as a significant invasion of <em>Americans`</em> privacy. Well, President <em>Obama</em> recently announced that he`d made major changes in the way the <em>NSA</em> gathers information. But he`s not stopping the agency from gathering it. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>CROWD: No secret (inaudible)! </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: After months of spirited debate sparked by the explosive <em>revelations</em> of <em>Edward</em> Snowden, the president told <em>Americans</em> he`ll <em>rein</em> in <em>NSA</em> surveillance, but only to a point. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>BARACK</em> OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: The power of new technologies means that there are fewer and fewer technical <em>constraints</em> on what we can do. That places a special <em>obligation</em> on us to ask tough questions about what we should do. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: The most significant changes affect the most <em>controversial</em> <em>surveillance</em> program - the bulk collection of <em>Americans`</em> phone records, effective immediately, the <em>NSA</em> will need <em>judicial</em> approval before searching the data. The president asked Congress to create a panel of public <em>advocates</em> to counter government search requests. And he asked the <em>Attorney</em> General and intelligence committee to explore moving the data out of <em>NSA</em> control. But the bottom line, the program <em>won`t</em> necessarily end. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>CROWD: They say (INAUDIBLE) </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>CROWD: We say (INAUDIBLE) </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: For the <em>NSA`s</em> most <em>ardent</em> critics that would be a glaring omission. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>SEN. <em>RAND</em> PAUL: <em>I</em> didn`t hear any lessening of the spying on <em>Americans</em> or collecting records of Americans. <em>I</em> heard that trust me, <em>I`m</em> going to put some more <em>safeguards</em> in place, but <em>I`m</em> going to keep right on collecting every <em>American`s</em> records. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: The president argues that much of the <em>surveillance</em> is just too important to <em>scrap</em> altogether. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>OBAMA: Not only because <em>I</em> felt that they made us more secure, but also because nothing in that initial review and nothing that <em>I`ve</em> learned since indicated that our intelligence community has <em>sought</em> to <em>violate</em> the law. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: So, do any of the changes make us less safe? </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>PETER BERGEN, <em>CNN</em> <em>TERRORISM</em> ANALYST: If these programs were stopping huge <em>terrorist</em> attacks, you know, maybe they would - should be more, you know, there should be more concern. But the fact is that these programs are not. </p>

<p>AZUZ: Yesterday honored <em>American</em> civil rights leader Dr. <em>Martin</em> <em>Luther</em> King Jr. It became a federal holiday in 1983, and 11 years later, it became a national day of service, a one of a kind event. Dr. King once said, everybody can be great, because everybody can serve. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>President <em>Obama</em> <em>participated</em> in the service project in Washington, D.C. You see him here <em>volunteering</em> at D.C. central kitchen, in organization that aims to reduce hunger and poverty. Also, in the U.S. capital, the traditional <em>wreath</em> laying at the King Memorial. The National Park Service says millions visited the first full year it was open in 2012, and millions visited last year on the 50th <em>anniversary</em> of Dr. King`s march on Washington. <em>Brian</em> <em>Todd</em> looks back at that event. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>BRIAN</em> TODD, <em>CNN</em> CORRESPONDENT: Many of them were so young that summer, <em>Martin</em> <em>Luther</em> King Jr. himself only 34, but they led hundreds of thousands on the march to the nation`s capital that would <em>pivot</em> the country toward <em>irreversible</em> change. "Time" magazine captures that moment in a <em>tribute</em> to King. Time editor <em>Radhika</em> <em>Jones</em> says the use of the key players then was a <em>crucial</em> component in publishing this <em>tribute</em> now. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>RADHIKA</em> JONES, EXEC. EDITOR, TIME MAGAZINE: They are still with us. They can tell their own stories, and it was so important to us to talk to them directly and here, there are memories of that day. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>TODD: The memories come from people like <em>Clarence</em> Jones, King`s speechwriter. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>In a <em>testimonial</em> on "Time`s" website, he describes the moment King grabbed his audience. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>CLARENCE</em> B. JONES, <em>MARTIN</em> <em>LUTHER</em> KING <em>JR.`S</em> SPEECHWRITER: <em>I`m</em> listening to his speech, and as <em>I`m</em> listening, <em>I</em> see that he`s really - <em>Mahalia</em> <em>Jackson</em> interrupted him while he`s speaking. Tell them about the dream, Martin! Tell them about the dream! Body language changed. And he changed what <em>I</em> call the <em>Baptist</em> <em>preacher`s</em> test task (ph). And <em>I</em> say to the person standing next to me, whoever that was, <em>I</em> said these people don`t know it, but they are about ready to go to church. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>TODD: When King`s body language changed, so did the speech and with it, a movement. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>MARTIN</em> <em>LUTHER</em> KING JR.: <em>I</em> have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live up the true meaning of its dream. We hold this truth to be self- evident that all men are created equal. </p>

<p>AZUZ: Time for the <em>CNN</em> STUDENT NEWS "Roll Call" and this one, for the birds. We mean the Eagles of <em>Edgartown</em> School. They are <em>parched</em> in Edgartown, Massachusetts. We mean the Silver Hawks of <em>Lincoln</em> Southwest High School. They are taking flight from Lincoln, Nebraska. And we mean the Red Hawks of Liberty High School. They are <em>soaring</em> over Frisco, Texas. </p>

<p>Germany, Russia, Canada, Switzerland, all countries associated with winter sports, all countries that have done well in the <em>Olympics</em> <em>bobsled</em> competition. How about Jamaica? The <em>Caribbean</em> country just got a word <em>Saturday</em> that it has qualified for next month Winter <em>Olympics</em> in Russia. But that was just one of the challenges the storied team faced. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: Get up! It`s <em>bobsled</em> time! </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: For the first time in more than a decade, the biggest <em>underdogs</em> in <em>bobsledding</em> had to fight the odds and qualify for the <em>Olympic</em> Games. But the <em>Jamaican</em> <em>bobsled</em> team isn`t packing their bags just yet. The problem? They need a lot of money, fast. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>WINSTON</em> WATTS, TEAM CAPTAIN </p>
<p>ILOT: That`s why we are looking (INAUDIBLE) we can <em>fulfill</em> the dream. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: The team needs to raise as much $80,000 to cover travel and equipment fees, so they`ve turned the <em>fundraising</em> <em>websites</em> like <em>Crowdtilt</em> to try and make it happen. In just under 24 hours, the team raised more than $16,000 and <em>donations</em> continue to poor in. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>MARVIN</em> DIXON, BRAKEMAN: We`re Jamaican. We believe, you know, it`s going to (inaudible). </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: We are not <em>bobsledding</em> yet? </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: Oh, yes, we are! </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: The <em>Jamaican`s</em> are among the most famous teams in the sport due in large part to the <em>popularity</em> of the <em>Disney</em> <em>classic</em> "Cool Runnings" that <em>chronicle</em> the <em>Olympic</em> journey of the country`s first <em>bobsled</em> team. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>After missing the last two Winter Olympics, the <em>Jamaican</em> <em>bobsledders</em> were determined to qualify for Sochi. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>DIXON: This is such a really, really great feeling. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: The team who refers to themselves as "Cool Runnings" the sequel, knows that the odds are stocked against them. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>DIXON: A lot of people ask us if we are really crazy. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: But they are hoping that with some help, they`ll have another shot at <em>Olympic</em> glory. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>DIXON: It`s not many people can say they are from a tropical country, be not there and do a sport, which is winter sports, and we are so good at it. </p>

<p>AZUZ: <em>Derek</em> <em>Jakons</em> (ph) hadn`t seen his mother in eight months. She`s in a U.S. Air Force, and she`s been <em>deployed</em> in the Middle East. She got home last week, but she didn`t immediately tell Derek. She decided to surprise him at a basketball game while he was playing. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: So the plan is to call a <em>fake</em> (inaudible) <em>tech</em> on the coach, and then we`re going to have <em>Derek</em> go out to the line, for two or three throws and then that`s when we have his <em>mom</em> come from behind and that - will get surprised. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> FEMALE: <em>I`m</em> nervous, because <em>I</em> don`t know what his reaction is going to be. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> FEMALE: <em>I`m</em> thinking he`ll say <em>Mommy</em> and give me a hug. You know, we are at a basketball game, his friends are here, girls are here. Maybe he`ll cry, but then he`ll be mad at me. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: That`s all right, Derek! </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(LAUGHTER) </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(APPLAUSE) </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> FEMALE: He cried a little bit. But that`s OK. That was his natural reaction. That was Derek. And that`s really the reaction <em>I</em> thought he would have. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>
<em>UNIDENTIFIED</em> MALE: Mom, <em>I</em> missed you. </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>AZUZ: She`d missed all of football season and the holidays, so she thought the basketball game was worth a shot. There was nothing <em>foul</em> about it in the true sense of the word, it was a <em>homecoming</em> game. <em>I`m</em> <em>Carl</em> Azuz, for <em>CNN</em> STUDENT NEWS. </p>
