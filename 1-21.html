<p>CARL AZUZ  CNN ANCHOR. </p>
<p> Technology is the theme this Wednesday on CNN STUDENT NEWS. </p>
<p> Thank you for watching. </p>
<p> We`ve got reports involving Internet connectivity and Internet <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;behemoth&quot;,['behemoth'])" style="color:blue">behemoth</em> safety for travelers. </p>
<p> We want to get to it as soon as we can dig out from all of this snow. </p>
<p> Well  not in Atlanta. </p>
<p> But the U. </p>
<p>S. </p>
<p> Midwest and Northeast are getting are one-two punch this week. </p>
<p> Sounds familiar. </p>
<p> They`ve had a <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;wicked&quot;,['wicked','wick','wicke'])" style="color:blue">wicked</em> winter. </p>
<p> This time around  some Northeast streets could be under ice. </p>
<p> Last year  the Farmer`s Almanac had predicted a bitterly cold winter for the region  and a major storm right around the time of the Super Bowl. </p>
<p> Looks like they`ve got it right. </p>
<p> Preparations for it might have taken a <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;toll&quot;,['toll'])" style="color:blue">toll</em> on other parts of the Northeast. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE). </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE. </p>
<p> Millions along the East Coast are digging out of Monday`s record breaking snowstorm. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE. </p>
<p> Snow is coming down faster than we can plough it. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE. </p>
<p> The winter storm transforming New York Central Park into a winter wonderland in just hours  setting a new daily record of eight inches. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE. </p>
<p> I think I`m ready for the summer. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE. </p>
<p> For thousands of travelers heading home from Sunday Super Bowl  the airports were anything  but a wonderland. </p>
<p> And more than 2 000 flights canceled on Monday due to the storm. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE. </p>
<p> We`re trying to get to Chicago. </p>
<p> My flights are a couple of hours delayed. </p>
<p> We are just hoping it will actually take off. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE. </p>
<p> Parts of New Jersey pummeled with nine inches  forcing Governor Christie to issue a state of emergency. </p>
<p> Central New Jersey officials blaming the Super Bowl for impacting their ability to battle the snow. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>ROBERT BIANCO  SUPERINTENDENT FOR PUBLIC WORKS  MONTCLAIR  NEW JERSEY. </p>
<p> Most of the salt in this general area has been going towards the middle (ph) lands for the Super Bowl. </p>
<p> The local municipalities in the counties have been struggling to get it. </p>
<p> And this has been going on since the middle of December. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE. </p>
<p> A new winter storm will pack a one two punch into Wednesday. </p>
<p> With heavy snow and ice forecast in more than two dozen states. </p>
<p> Kansas City <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;bracing&quot;,['bracing','brac','brace'])" style="color:blue">bracing</em> for ten inches of snow. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP). </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>AZUZ. </p>
<p> The Obama administration believes that for American students to compete with other students around the world  they need to have the same technology as students in some other countries. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP). </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>BARACK OBAMA  PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. </p>
<p> Technology can help. </p>
<p> It`s a tool. </p>
<p> It`s just one more tool. </p>
<p> So  today the average school has about the same Internet bandwidth as the average American home. </p>
<p> But it serves 200 times as a many people. </p>
<p> Only around 30 percent of our students have true high speed Internet in the classroom. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>(END VIDEO CLIP). </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>AZUZ. </p>
<p> The president asked for and got commitments from companies like Verizon  Apple  <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;AT&amp;T&quot;,['at&amp;t'])" style="color:red">AT&amp;T</em>  Microsoft and Sprint. </p>
<p> They promise to give or discount millions of dollars-worth of services and devices to students. </p>
<p> The government is also putting $2 billion toward high speed Internet in schools. </p>
<p> The White House says the money is already set aside and it <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;won`t&quot;,['won't','wo'])" style="color:red">won`t</em> add to the deficit. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Not everyone agrees that all electronic technologies good for students. </p>
<p> Some experts are concerned about its potential effects on younger kids` attention spans. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Staying online. </p>
<p> Facebook turned ten years old yesterday. </p>
<p> At Facebook. </p>
<p>com/cnnstudentnews  we are asking what you think of that. </p>
<p> Carol is surprised it`s lasted this long and still thrives. </p>
<p> Abel or Abel says that`s pretty old for Internet age and it shows how fast time is going. </p>
<p> One out of every six people in the world uses Facebook. </p>
<p> And Facebook knows a lot about its users. </p>
<p> How old you are  where you live  go to school or work and what you like. </p>
<p> The things you`re talking about with your friends  the things you share with them and what you click on. </p>
<p> It`s <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;incredibly&quot;,['incredibly'])" style="color:blue">incredibly</em> valuable information. </p>
<p> Facebook makes 19 percent of its money by selling ads  and your info helps it to do that. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>How else has Facebook changed their lives. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE). </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>DOUG GROSS  CNN CORRESPONDENT. </p>
<p> So  Facebook is turning ten years old and it really is an <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;unprecedented&quot;,['unprecedented','unprecedent','unprecedente'])" style="color:blue">unprecedented</em> story in sort of Internet history as well as social media history. </p>
<p> To tell the story  you can start with one number  1. </p>
<p>2 billion. </p>
<p> That`s how many active monthly users Facebook has. </p>
<p> Compare that to Twitter that has 250 million and you <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;literally&quot;,['literally'])" style="color:blue">literally</em> can take (inaudible) user base at almost a billion more. </p>
<p> That`s how many you have for Facebook. </p>
<p> And that really plays a party on why it`s changed so many people`s lives. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>This year number really is part of the story. </p>
<p> Facebook has allowed people in the way they`ve never been able to before to reach people from parts of their lives they thought were totally gone. </p>
<p> To find people from elementary school  high school  college  find old teachers  find old friends they never thought they`d meet again. </p>
<p> Sure  MySpace was out there first  sure  Friendster was around first  but this isn`t just your college and young adults and high school students. </p>
<p> This is everybody. </p>
<p> This is your aunt  your uncle  your grandma. </p>
<p> So  the ability to find and connect with people on Facebook is something we`ve never seen in Internet history. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>You just think about the things we do differently because of Facebook now. </p>
<p> Birth announcements  wedding announcements  pictures of the kids - things like that. </p>
<p> Even in the era of email  you`d have to sort of make your lists  send these things out. </p>
<p> Now  you can really with one click sort of make these major life announcement to everybody you care about - to your family  your friends - they are all there. </p>
<p> If you are a Web-enabled person in 2014  odds are you have a Facebook account  and that means we can find each other in ways that we never could have considered before  even in the Internet age. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>(END VIDEOTAPE). </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE. </p>
<p> Time for the  Shoutout. </p>
<p>  Where would you find a <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;flywheel&quot;,['flywheel'])" style="color:blue">flywheel</em>  <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;pitman&quot;,['pitman'])" style="color:blue">pitman</em> arm and a <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;crank&quot;,['crank'])" style="color:blue">crank</em> case. </p>
<p> If you think you know it  shout it out. </p>
<p> Are they in a sewing machine  <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;loom&quot;,['loom'])" style="color:blue">loom</em>  wireless controller or automobile. </p>
<p> You`ve got three seconds  go. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Anyone who`s ridden in the school bus has experience with these - they are all auto parts. </p>
<p> That`s your answer and that`s your shoutout. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>AZUZ. </p>
<p> Something else that could be coming soon to a vehicle near you. </p>
<p> More technology. </p>
<p> The kind that could help your car talk to others around it. </p>
<p> Unlike some proposed cars of the futures it would not actually do the driving for you. </p>
<p> But it could warn you about what other drivers are doing. </p>
<p> The U. </p>
<p>S. </p>
<p> government may require this feature in the future  but it would add to the cost of the car. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE). </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>ANNOUNCER. </p>
<p> Warning. </p>
<p> Vehicle breaking ahead. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>RENE MARSH  CNN CORRESPONDENT. </p>
<p> It`s the vehicle of the future  cars that talk to the driver and each other. </p>
<p> The federal government wants it on the road soon  pushing for technology that would warn drivers of danger coming from any direction. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>ANNOUNCER. </p>
<p> Coming along. </p>
<p> The light is green. </p>
<p> Everything looks fine. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE. </p>
<p> And all of a sudden  we get that warning that says  you know  look out. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>MARSH. </p>
<p> It`s called vehicle to vehicle technology. </p>
<p> Cars would send wireless message to each other within about 300 yard radius. </p>
<p> Communicating information like speed  direction and GPS position ten times per second. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>ANTHONY FOXX  SECRETARY OF TRANSPORTATION. </p>
<p> When cars share this information  they can account for all the vehicles around them. </p>
<p> Which means they are able to identify possible crashes. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>MARSH. </p>
<p> The technology sees around corners  over hills and through other vehicle. </p>
<p> So let`s just say  five cars ahead of me  the driver slams on the brakes. </p>
<p> Well  that car sends my car a message giving me enough time to react. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>33 000 Americans are killed and 2. </p>
<p>3 million injured in car crashes every year. </p>
<p> The Department of Transportation predicts  talking cars could prevent up to 80 percent of crashes involving sober drivers. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Five major car companies have been working with DoT on developing and testing the technology. </p>
<p> 3 000 cars in Ann Arbor  Michigan are already using it as part of the government pilot test. </p>
<p> Sometime after 2016  the federal government hopes your car will be able to communicate with you. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Well  the DoT hopes to propose the rule by 2016  but it will still need the public to weigh in before anything is finalized. </p>
<p> The bottom line is  it`s a <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;lengthy&quot;,['lengthy'])" style="color:blue">lengthy</em> process to get something like this mandated. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>Now  as for privacy  the government says that data sent between cars doesn`t record personal information  so your privacy should not be compromised. </p>

<p> On our  Roll Call   worldwide Wednesday is when we recognize some of the international schools using our show. </p>
<p> So  without further <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;ado&quot;,['ado'])" style="color:blue">ado</em>  hello to the students of Spangdahlem Middle School. </p>
<p> They are online watching CNN STUDENT NEWS in Spangdahlem  Germany. </p>

<p>Over to South America  to Dourados City  Brazil. </p>
<p> Shoutout to our viewers at Escola  Biegas (ph). </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>And across the Pacific  we`re happy to see you in Miyazaki City  Japan. </p>
<p> It`s the home of our friends at Miyazaki or Miya High School. </p>

<p>Landing today`s show at the <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;culmination&quot;,['culmination'])" style="color:blue">culmination</em> of <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;mechanic&quot;,['mechanic'])" style="color:blue">mechanic</em> capability  the A-packs of <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;advancement&quot;,['advancement'])" style="color:blue">advancement</em> and technology  the paper airplane. </p>
<p> But not just any 8. </p>
<p>5 by 11 origami. </p>
<p> This thing is made out of manila (ph) folders  built to scale  detailed to perfection you can almost feel the <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;turbulence&quot;,['turbulence'])" style="color:blue">turbulence</em>  you all. </p>
<p> It`s four feet long. </p>
<p> It took a 22 year old <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;aviation&quot;,['aviation'])" style="color:blue">aviation</em> enthusiasts  about 400 manila folders and 10 000 hours to folge (ph). </p>
<p> Should we say build. </p>
<p>. </p>
<p>It <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;won`t&quot;,['won't','wo'])" style="color:red">won`t</em> actually fly  so we`ve got the idea  we`ll get off the ground with others. </p>
<p> That thing is <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;intricate&quot;,['intricate'])" style="color:blue">intricate</em>  from the nose to detail. </p>
<p> Though it`s <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;monochromatic&quot;,['monochromatic'])" style="color:blue">monochromatic</em>  it`s still a great looking <em onclick="addNewWord(&quot;runway&quot;,['runway'])" style="color:blue">runway</em> model  no  it`s lightweight  it still tips the scale and thanks to those images  we could show it to you for free without any pay per view charges. </p>
